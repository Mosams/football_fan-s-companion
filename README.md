# FOOTBALL FAN COMPANION APP

> Football Fan Companion is an applications that presents the user with different leagues on the homepage where he/she/they can choose a league to view its team's data.
> The app was developed from a football api which presents team data filtered from a given league and the general league table that is generated from the data.
> I felt that the project would be a good addition to the football world given I am a big fan of the sport and I am always in need of an updates on the progress of the leagues I am interested in.
